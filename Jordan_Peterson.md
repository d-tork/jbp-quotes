The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 54 - Aspen Ideas Festival: From the Barricades of the Culture Wars

[11:23] “Just because you _read_ something doesn’t mean you have a _right_ to it. You have to understand it, and understanding something that’s deep means a deep transformation, means you have to _live it._

The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 44 - Lafayette College - The Mill Series

[29:49] “And the way that totalitarian states develop is that people give up their right to be, the right to exist with their own thoughts. They lie! That’s what happens, is that individuals sacrifice their own souls to the dictates of the state. And then everything goes badly sideways. And it’s like, you think how much evidence for that do we need? Y’know, you’re looking at a quarter of a billion deaths. It’s like, isn’t that enough?

Well the people that I read were profound—Victor Frankel is a good example for beginners if you wanna read about this sort of thing, wrote a book called _Man’s Search for Meaning_. And Frankel, and also Solzhenitsyn, and a variety of other commentators as well who _really_ looked into what happened both in Nazi Germany and the Communist states. **Their conclusion was universal: that the lies and tyranny of the state are aided and abetted by the moral sacrifice of the individual.** It’s not top-down, the Nazis telling you what to do and you’re all innocent and obey. THAT’S not how it works—is you falsify your being, bit by bit, and you end up where you don’t wanna be. And that’s a _bad_ idea.

And if you’re interested in that there’s a great book called _Ordinary Men_…you read that and you won’t be the same person afterwards, so I would beware of reading it. But it’s a story about these policemen in Germany. So they were middle-aged guys, y’know, and they grew up and were socialized before the Nazis came to power, so they were just your typical middle class policemen. And they were brought into Poland after the Nazis had marched through and charged with keeping order in the occupied state. And their commander knew that it was going to be brutal, because they were in wartime, and they regard the Jews for example as enemies, so there was going to be a fair bit of rounding up and all of that, and with all of what that implied.

And the commander told the policemen that they could go home if they wanted to, that they didn’t have to participate in this. And then, what _Ordinary Men_ does is document their transformation from ordinary policemen—the sort of people that you know—to guys who were taking naked, pregnant women out into the middle of fields and shooting them in the back of the head. And it documents ONE STEP AT A TIME how an ordinary person turns into someone like that. You think ‘well, we don’t want that sort of thing to happen anymore.’ Well, then you don’t wanna be that sort of person. That’s how it’s fixed. And if you’re not gonna be that sort of person **then you don’t take the first steps.** Cuz the first steps lead you down a pathway you don’t—at least in principle—you don’t wanna go.

So, I think part of what makes me combative, compared to someone like [Jonathan] Haidt, is I’ve spent years looking at the worst things there are to look at. And I’ve learned from that. And I’ve certainly learned things that I won’t do. And one of them is I won’t let the government regulate my speech. It’s a mistake. I don’t care what compassionate principles hypothetically motivate that move. It was _unprecedented_ in English common law, that move. It was all buried under this leftist “compassion” which is mostly… it’s mostly a lie.

The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 26 - The Phenomenology of the Divine

[1:26:15] “I’d also say if you’re interested in Jung, the best book to read is _The Origins and History of Consciousness_. It’s the best intro to the Jungian world.”

[1:44:40] “But that’s the Holy Grail, and the Holy Grail is lost—that’s the redemptive substance—and the knights of King Arthur go off to search for the Holy Grail. But they don’t know where to look! So, where do you look when you don’t know where to look? For something you need, desperately, but have lost? Well, each of the knights goes into the forest at the point that looks darkest to him.

And that’s Jungian psychoanalysis in a nutshell. It’s like: **that which you fear and avoid. That which you hold in contempt. That which disgusts you and that you avoid. That’s the gateway to what you need to know.** There’s nothing new-age about that, that’s for sure.”

  

  

The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 25 - Walking With God: Noah and the Flood

[15:45] “You’ve got the fact that things aren’t exactly the way they should be at least gives you something to do, y’know, and maybe something _great_ to do, cuz there’s no shortage of suffering and trouble that besets the world that you could conceivably ameliorate in some way. And the utility of that and the intrinsic meaning of that is self-evident.

So it also makes me curious about nihilism, for example, and despair, because—I understand those emotions, I understand them deeply, and the intellectual mindset that goes along with it; but they just seem beside the point to me in some sense because there are so many things that need doing, that all you really have to do is open your eyes and look at them, and then decide that you’re actually going to do something about them.

And you might think ‘well, what’s within my scope of influence is so trivial that it’s not worth doing.’ It’s like, it won’t stay trivial for long if you do it! Not at all. And I don’t think it’s trivial to begin with. I don’t think that any—I really don’t believe that anything done right is trivial. And my experience in my life has been that anything I actually did paid off. It didn’t pay off necessarily in the way that I expected it to pay off, that’s a whole different story. But if it was _genuine_ _commitment to do something_, even if it went sideways and the outcome was really something other than what I expected, the net consequence over time was nothing but good.”

[20:28] “The issue is that there are times in your life where you know that the thing that you’re saying is not true. It’s a deception. It’s a lie of some sort, and you’re using it to manipulate yourself or another person or the world. And you’re also fully possessed of the idea that you can get away with it. And there’s a satanic arrogance about that. In fact, that _is_ the archetypal arrogance that’s portrayed in the mythological character of Satan, because Satan is precisely the archetype of the element of the mind that believes that it can twist and bend the structure of reality without paying the price for that.

And you can’t imagine anything that’s more arrogant than that because really, do you really think that you can twist the structure of reality and that that’s going to work out for you without it snapping back, is so obvious that that can’t work, that everyone knows it.”

[23:11] “And the warning in the Flood story is: don’t [feed with no gratitude and no attempt to replenish what it is that you’re taking from] for very long. Because things will happen that are so awful that you cannot possibly imagine it. And that’ll happen to you personally, and it’ll happen to your family, and it’ll happen to your community, and it’s happened to people over and over throughout history.

And it’s quite interesting, y’know, it’s very soon after the story of Cain and Abel, when you see evil enter the world in the story of Adam and Eve; along with self-consciousness and evil there is the ability—that’s the knowledge of good and evil—that’s the ability to **hurt other people**—self-consciously, to _know_ what you’re doing, and then of course instantly Cain takes that to the absolute extreme and he uses that capacity to **destroy, really, what he loves best.** He gets as close as a human being can to destroying the divine ideal. Because, of course, his brother is Abel and Abel is favored by God, and Cain destroys him.

Which, Cain tells God at the end of that episode that his punishment is more than he can bear. And I think the reason for that is: **where are you once you destroy your own ideal?** What’s left for you? There’s nowhere to go. There’s no up. And when there’s no up, there’s a lot of down.

And, y’know, there’s an idea put forth very nicely in Milton’s _Paradise Lost_, when he was describing, from a psychological perspective, essentially what hell is. And hell is—you’re in hell to the degree that you’re distant from the good. That might be a good way of thinking about it. And if you destroy your own ideal, which you do with jealousy and resentment and the desire to pull down people who you would like to be, let’s say, then you end up in a situation that’s indistinguishable from hell.

And the way the Biblical story unfolds is, well, it’s Cain…and then it’s the flood. And so Cain adopts this mode of being that’s antithetical to being itself, at least to positive being itself—he does it voluntarily, he does it knowing full well what he’s doing—and the net consequence of this, that it ripples through the entire social structure, is that God stands back and says: This whole thing has got [sic] so bad the only thing we can do is wipe it to the ground. And that is no joke. That’s _exactly_ how things work.”

[2:05:30] “I see this [intellectual arrogance] for example happening in the United States in particular because the last time I went down there, for example, I had friends down there and some of those friends are very, very smart people. And some of them were talking about the Trump voters. And they were talking about the Trump voters with contempt. And I thought ‘you better watch that. Cuz that’s 50% of the damn population. And it might be convenient to think that they’re stupid and beneath you, but it’s not conducive to a civil state, and there’s no evidence that it’s true, because there isn’t a straight line between intelligent and wise.’”

The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 24 - The Psychology of the Flood

[1:06:51] “I’m trying to formulate a sentence, so I try to think up a good sentence that’s nailing what I’m trying to formulate, and then I try to pick it apart. And I do that a bunch of ways; I take the sentence and I put it on another page and then I write, like, ten different variants of the sentence and see if I can get a better variant. And then I try to think of ways that it’s a stupid sentence to see if I can, y’know, put a pry bar underneath it and loosen it up.

And if I can’t do anything—if I can’t manage that then I keep the sentence that I’ve got. And I do that with ten sentences in a paragraph and I make sure the sentences are all arranged properly in the paragraph the same way, by rewriting a bunch of different variants of it, trying to get the word right and the phrase right and the sentence right and the sentence order right and the paragraph order right. And I can tell when it’s right _enough_ because I can’t make it any better.

That doesn’t mean it’s _right_, it just means *I* can’t improve it. And so I get to the point where if I’m writing a paragraph and I write a variant, and I can’t tell if the variant is any better and it might be worse, then I’m done. I’ve hit the limit of my intellectual capacity, and it’s time to move on.

The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 23 - Cain and Abel: The Hostile Brothers

[22:04] “This is one of mankind’s fundamental discoveries. Sometimes things do not go well. That’s self-evident. But here’s the rub: sometimes when things are not going well, it’s precisely that which is most valued that is the cause. Why? It’s because the world is revealed through the template of your values.

If the world you are seeing is not the world you want therefore, it’s time to examine your values. It’s time to rid yourself of your current presuppositions.”

The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 22 - Adam and Eve: Self-Consciousness, Evil, and Death

[1:29:18] “The other thing about marriage—this is really worth knowing too—is that—I learned this in part by reading Jung—it’s like what do you do when you get married? That’s easy. You take someone who’s just as useless and horrible as you are, and then you shackle yourself to them. And then you say: ‘we’re not runnin’ away. No matter what happens.’ Yeah, well that’s perfect because then you don’t get to run away.

And the thing is, is like if you can run away you can’t tell each other the truth. Because if you tell someone the truth about you and they don’t run away, they weren’t listening. And so if you don’t have someone around that can’t run away you can’t tell them the truth. And so that’s part of the purpose of the marriage. It’s like okay okay, I’ll bet on you, you bet on me, it’s a losing bet, we both know that. But given our current circumstances we’re unlikely to find anyone better, that’s for sure.

There are two things that come off of that. One is, y’know people are waiting around to find Mr. and Mrs. Right and it’s like, here’s something to think about, man. If you went to a party and you found Mr. Right, and he looked at you and didn’t run away screaming, that would indicate that he _wasn’t_ Mr. Right **at all**. It’s like the old Nietzschian joke: if someone loves you, that should immediately disenchant you with them.

The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 04 - Religion, Myth, Science, Truth

[2:07:58] “The shadow is rooted in hell. And you think, well, that’s a nice metaphor. It’s like, don’t be so sure it’s a metaphor. It’s not exactly a metaphor. I mean I can elaborate on that a little bit.

If you walk down Bloor Street (?) and you watch, you can see people in hell with no problem. They’re not only the people who are completely lost—the homeless—but they’re the homeless that you cannot look at. And the reason you can’t look at them is they find your act of mirroring their state of existence intolerable. It will instantly enrage them. And that’s because they’re in chaos, they’re in the underworld, but they’re in a particular suburb of the underworld. And that little suburb, that’s hell.

And you think ‘well, is it eternal?’ Depends on what you mean. It’s been around a long time. It’s been around a _long_ time. And it’s really deep. And there’s another weird thing about hell, which is: if you’re in it, no matter how bad it is, there’s some stupid thing you can do to make it worse. And that’s why it’s bottomless.”

  

  

The Jordan B. Peterson Podcast 21 - God and the Hierarchy of Authority

[2:40:20] “One of the things I’ve really tried to puzzle out, and it’s not like I believe this, right, I’m just telling you where the edges of my thinking has been going, is that you have this crazy alliance between the feminists and the radical Islamists that I just do not get. It’s like why aren’t they protesting non-stop about Saudi Arabia is just completely beyond me. Like I do NOT understand it in the least. And I wonder too, I just wonder—and this is the Freudian me—is that is there an attraction that’s emerging among the female radicals for that totalitarian male dominance that they’ve chased out of the West? And I mean that’s a hell of a thing to think but after all, I am psychoanalytically minded and I DO think things like that. [laughter]

Because I can just see no rational reason for it. The only other rational reason is that ‘well, the West needs to fall, and the enemy of my enemy is my friend.’ Yeah, so that could be the case. But I’m not going to shake my suspicion about this unconscious balancing because as the demand for egalitarianism and the eradication of masculinity accelerates, there’s going to be a longing in the unconscious for the precise opposite of that. The more you scream for equality, the more your unconscious is going to admire dominance.”

Jordan Peterson on the Channel 4 Controversy and Philosophy of "How to be in the World"

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6qBxn_hFDQ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E6qBxn_hFDQ)

[1:46:27] “Cuz one of the old metaphysical problems is ‘why would God allow evil into the world’. I think well maybe God didn’t allow evil into the world; maybe God allowed the possibility of evil into the world—that’s different. And maybe the world with the possibility of evil is actually a better world than the world without the possibility of evil.

It’s something like that, y’know, in that maybe a man is better when he is a dangerous man who is being good than he would be if we was just a good man who wasn’t capable of being dangerous. And I believe that because the best men that I have ever met are very dangerous men. You don’t mess with them.”

Indian dude: “So do you think that someone without teeth, or without the options to sin, can be good?”

Peterson: “See that’s a real theological question, right? Cuz the question you’re asking is—and this is tied up with the idea of free will and evil—‘can a person who doesn’t have the option to be evil be good? And I would say no.”

[1:51:07] “One of the most amazing things I discovered this year, or stumbled upon, was I was puzzling over a line in the New Testament which I’ve always been curious about because it never sat right with me: ‘the meek shall inherit the earth.’ …and I found out that the word ‘meek’ either doesn’t mean now what it meant when people first translated the text, or it was a mistranslation. Either way. Because ‘meek’ sounds like ‘powerless’ and ‘harmless’ or something like that. But what ‘meek’ actually means is it’s the derivation of the word, it’s the translation of a word that meant something more like ‘**those who have swords and know how to use them, but keep them sheathed.**’

And I thought ‘oh yes, that’s exactly it.’ Those who have swords and know how to use them but choose to keep them sheathed… ‘shall inherit the world.’ It’s like _yes._ Exactly right.”

  

  

The Art of Manliness Podcast #335: Exploring Archetypes with Jordan B. Peterson

[https://www.artofmanliness.com/2017/08/31/podcast-335-using-power-myths-live-flourishing-life/](https://www.artofmanliness.com/2017/08/31/podcast-335-using-power-myths-live-flourishing-life/)

*Note: just minutes before this monologue, Jordan Peterson makes a distinction between his use of the terms masculine/feminine versus male/female; they are not always equivalent in the analysis of archetypal stories.

“If you look at the movie _Sleeping Beauty_, for example. So the female—the feminine—is unconscious in that movie, that’s Sleeping Beauty. And she’s unconscious because she couldn’t tolerate the trauma of puberty and sexual development, essentially. And the reason for that is because her parents overprotected her, right?

If you remember at the beginning of _Sleeping Beauty_, the king and queen have been waiting a long time for their daughter to decide not to invite Maleficent to the christening. And Maleficent is the evil queen, right, she’s the negative element of nature and the world, and if you don’t invite the negative—if you don’t _allow_ the negative element of life and the world into your child’s environment then you overprotect them and make them weak, and then when they grow up and face the inevitable confrontations of adolescence and adulthood, they deeply desire to remain unconscious, or to become unconscious again. That can manifest itself in suicidal ideation, for example.

So Sleeping Beauty falls unconscious when she’s pricked, when blood emerges when she’s pricked, and it’s just after she, y’know, she falls in love naïvely with the prince, and then that collapses. So she can’t tolerate the catastrophe of her existence so she falls unconscious. And something has to rescue her. And it’s the hero, it’s the prince.

Now, you can read that as an external prince because in some degree, in a woman’s life, the adult feminine in her is awakened by the man that she chooses. So you can read it as a love story, but you can also read it as a story of individual development because what the woman is going to use to call _herself_ out of unconsciousness is her own masculine propensity to develop her consciousness to move forthright out into the world. I mean these archetypal stories can be read at multiple levels of analysis simultaneously, they apply across multiple domains.”

[16:00] “Those experiences in life where the fundamental constants that keep you oriented shift, and then you fall into the unknown, that’s the underworld of mythology. You fall into the unknown. And part of that underworld would be hell. Now hell is the part of the underworld that emerges when you’re embittered by your failure and you turn towards the desire to destroy. And everyone who thinks about this can appreciate that, because most people—at least if they reflect on their own experience—can understand full well the negative psychological consequences of falling flat on your face. It’s not only that you fail, it’s that you become bitter and turn agains the world. That’s a trip to hell for all intents and purposes.”

[47:25] “When young men mature and become men, it isn’t power that accrues to them, it’s competence. And the problem with the narrative that grips our culture at the moment is that we fail to make a distinction between power and competence. Power is just that I can hurt you and therefore I dominate. Competence is that I have status because I am offering to myself and to other people something that they voluntarily regard as of value. And my invitation to young men is to become competent, to forego power. Power is the tactic used by the incompetent to gain status. Competence is the tool used by the morally oriented to accrue authority and do good things in the world. Well that’s a noble call. And the only way out of the tragedy of existence is to follow the noble call.”

Jordan Peterson on the Illuminati

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnIFlD5Zvs8](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XnIFlD5Zvs8)

[7:40] “Life isn’t a game, it’s a set of games. And the rule is: never sacrifice victory across the set of games for victory in one game. Right? And that’s what it means to play properly. You wanna play so that people keep inviting you to play. Cuz that’s how you win—you win by being invited to play the largest possible array of games. And the way you do that is by manifesting the fact that you can play in a reciprocal manner every time you play even if there’s victory at stake. And that’s what makes you successful across time.

[8:40] “And to act morally is not to win today’s contest at the expense of the rest of possible contests. And again, I don’t see that as something that’s arbitrary. It’s not relativistic. There’s an absolute moral stance there, and everyone recognizes it. And I also think it’s the key to success.

And I would also say it’s very much akin in a strange way, like the person who is the master at being invited to play the largest possible number of games is also the same person that goes out forthrightly to conquer the unknown before it presents itself as the enemy at the door. They’re the same thing.”

[10:08] “There’s a recognition there in the image that the person who’s most dominant—who has the most authority—is the one who’s voluntarily accepted the suffering that’s a part of being. And that’s what that picture represents. It’s like the authority holds [a cross] and says ‘This is what you have to accept.’ And that transfixes the viewer, because of the fact that it’s true.

Think about it this way: do you like brave people, or do you like cowards? Well that’s pretty straightforward. And what’s the ultimate act of bravery? It’s to come to terms with the fact that you’re mortal and limited, and to live forthrightly regardless. Well obviously, that’s what is at the core of what’s admirable.”

Joe Rogan Experience #1006 Jordan Peterson & Bret Weinstein (Sep 1, 2017)

[37:50] “Get it into your head that you have the capacity for great evil. And stop targeting—stop assuming that that’s something manifesting itself only in the people that you disagree with politically. Take responsibility for that, and try to put your life together.”

[1:45:30] “What Marx observed was that capital tended to accumulate in the hands of fewer and fewer people. And he said that’s a flaw of the capitalist system. THAT’S wrong. It’s not a flaw of the capitalist system. It is a _feature_ of every single system of production that we know of no matter who set it up and how it operates. And so now we have a problem, because what happens is as soon as you set up a domain of production—and you need to because you need things to be produced—then you instantly produce a competition, and the spoils go disproportionately to a tiny percentage of people.

So then, so what? So the rest of the people starve, or the system becomes unstable because everybody’s mad. It’s like, that’s a big problem. Kay, so how do human beings fix that? Well the first thing we did was diversify the number of productive games. So you don’t get to be an NBA basketball star, okay, but you can run a podcast. It’s a completely different competitive landscape. So we can fractionate the production landscape, and then people who aren’t successful in one domain might be successful in others; that’s human creativity.”

[5:38] “Actually I’d just as soon we got rid of the whole hate speech thing because I think it’s unbelievably dangerous to drive people who hate underground **and not let them talk.** That’s partly because you don’t know where they are, you don’t know what they’re doing, and **you can’t refute them.”**

The Joe Rogan Experience #958 - Jordan Peterson

[1:41:35] “So imagine that the normal world of mankind is inside that dominance hierarchy where everything is going well, because nothing abnormal is happening and you’re getting what you need and you want and your conscious knowledge suffices. Right? Okay, but then something tilts, and that structure no longer works. Where do you end up? You end up in the underworld. That’s when your partner of 20 years has a long-term affair, and you find out about it. It’s like you thought you knew where you were…but you didn’t. And now that you found out, you don’t know where you are. **When you don’t know where you are, you’re in the underworld.**

Right, and that’s where the unconscious forces play: those are the gods, that’s why there’s gods in the underworld. And people go to the underworld all the time. It’s chaos and fear and depression, and hopelessness and imaginativeness, it’s everything—it’s chaos. It’s terrifying _and_ promising, because dragons have gold. Because the unknown has two things, just like the future. It’s like ‘look out, it’ll do you in’ and ‘look out, it offers everything to you.’ That’s the underworld.”

[2:03:15] “We’re very complicated creatures, and we’re run by all sorts of very strange things down there in the unconscious, y’know, and the Greeks thought we were the playthings of the gods because we serve lust, we serve thirst, we serve hunger, we serve _rage_. And y’know those things all transcend us. So that’s why they were gods. Y’know, rage—that’s the war god. Well, why is it a god? Well, it exists forever. It exists in all people. It takes them over and directs their behavior. It’s a god.

Well, you can quibble about the details: ‘no it’s not a god.’ Ok fine, it’s a psychological force.”

Rogan: “Right, people get hung up on that one word.”

Peterson: “Well they don’t really… we have to think about it functionally to some degree, we have to think about what that idea means. We’ve had that idea forever; it isn’t just some superstition. Jesus, you gotta be more sophisticated than that, man! And this is partly what I think is unfortunate about the new atheists, let’s say: they don’t take the damn problem seriously. They think ‘well, Christianity, that’s just a bunch of superstition.’ It’s like: really?? No. Sorry. That’s just not deep enough man.

[2:24:46] “So then we ask people: ‘Ok, so here think about this real carefully. Take all your faults and inadequacies, and your hatred for life, all of that. And imagine that gets the upper hand. And then think about where you could be in three to five years.’ Everyone knows, eh?

Some people know they’d be a street person, some people know they’d be an alcoholic, some people know they’d be a prostitute or a drug addict. Like everybody’s got their own little hell they could descend into, with fair degree of rapidity and a fair bit of enjoyment. And people _know_ that, and so I say well, delineate that out too, so you know where you’re headed when you fall off the path. And so then you’re running away, and running towards…it’s like yes, that’s heaven and hell. And you need it. And they’re real. They’re as real as anything you can… It depends on what you mean by ‘real’ I suppose, but… they’re as real as you make them, how about that. And people can make hell pretty real.”

[2:41:00] “I know for many people someone who’s rich is someone who has more money than them. Right? Which is one of the things I really find funny about the radical left protests on the campuses, it’s like ‘down with the 1%’. It’s like ‘hey, sunshine, you’re part of the 1%. You’re actually a baby 1/10th of 1% or maybe 1/100th of 1%, or you’re just angry because you’re not there _yet_. But you will be when you’re 40\. And you know it and so does everybody else. And now instead of regarding yourself properly as a fledgling member of the elite, you wanna have it both ways. You wanna be fledgling member of the elite, and champion of the underprivileged. So how narcissistic can you get? You wanna have all the benefits of having all the benefits, and you want all the benefits of having none of the benefits. Because just  all the benefits isn’t enough for you.”

“The basic totalitarian claim: What I know is everything that needs to be known, and if only it were manifest in the world, the world would become a utopia. I also think that that’s the core idea behind the Tower of Babel. It’s the idea that we can build a structure that makes the transcendent unnecessary.”

"What happens in the story of Adam and Eve is that when people become self conscious, they get thrown out of paradise and then they're in history. And history is a place where there's pain in child birth, and where you're dominated by your mate, and where you have to toil like mad like no other animal because you're aware of your future. You have to work and sacrifice the joys of the present for the future constantly, and you know that you're going to die. And you have all that weight on you. How could anything be more true than that? Unless you're naive beyond comprehension. There's something that's echoed about your life in that representation. We’re such strange creatures because we don't really fit into being in some sense, and that's what's expressed in the notion of The Fall."

"The notion that every single human being, regardless of their peculiarities and their strangenesses, and sins, and crimes, and all of that - has something divine in them that needs to be regarded with respect, plays an integral role, at least an analogous role, in the creation of habitable order out of chaos. It's a magnificent, remarkable, and crazy idea. Yet, we developed it and I do firmly believe that it sits at the base of our legal system. I think it is the cornerstone of our legal system. That's the notion that everyone is equal before God. That's such a strange idea. It's very difficult to understand how anybody could have ever come up with that idea, because the manifold differences between people are so obvious and so evident that you could say the natural way of viewing someone, or human beings, is in this extremely hierarchical manner where some people are contemptible and easily brushed off as pointless and pathological and without value whatsoever, and all the power accrues to a certain tiny aristocratic minority at the top, but if you look at the way that the idea of individual sovereignty developed, it is clear that it unfolded over thousands, perhaps tens of thousands of years, where it became something that was fixed in the imagination that each individual had something of transcendent value about them, and man I can tell you - we dispense with that idea at our serious peril. And if you're going to take that idea seriously - and you do because you act it out, because otherwise you wouldn't be law abiding citizens. It's shared by anyone who acts in a civilized manner - the question is: why in the world do you believe it? Assuming that you believe what you act out - which I think is a really good way of fundamentally defining belief."

"The proper path of life is to take the tradition and spirit that is associated with consciousness as such and to act it out in your own personal life in a way that is analogous with the way Christ acted it out in his life. What that means in part is the acceptance of the tragic preconditions of existence. That's partly: betrayal by friends and by family and by the state, it's partly punishment for sins that you did not commit (the arbitrary nature of justice), and the fact of finitude. Your duty, and the way to set things right in the cosmos is to accept all those details as necessary preconditions for being and to act virtuously despite all that. That's a very, very powerful idea."

"If you are not capable of cruelty, then you are absolutely a victim of anyone who is. For those who are exceedingly agreeable, there is a part of them crying out for the incorporation of the monster within them, which is what gives them strength of character and self respect, because it is impossible to respect yourself until you grow teeth. And if you grow teeth, you realize that you're somewhat dangerous, or seriously dangerous. Then you might be more willing to demand that you treat yourself with respect and that other people do the same thing. That doesn't mean that being cruel is better than not being cruel. **What it means is that being able to be cruel, and then not being cruel is better than not being able to be cruel, because in the first case you're nothing but weak and naive, and in the second case you're dangerous, but you have it under control.** If you're competent at fighting, it actually decreases the probability that you're going to have to fight, because when someone pushes you you'll be able to respond with confidence, and with any luck a reasonable show of confidence, which is a show of dominance, will be enough to make the bully back off."

"I know that the evidence for genuine religious experience is incontrovertible, but it's not  explicable. So I don't want to explain it away... I want to pull back from that and leave it as a fact and a mystery, and then we're going to look at this from a rational perspective, and say that the initial formulation of the idea of God was an attempt to abstract out the ideal, and to consider it as an abstraction outside its instantiation. And that's good enough. It's an amazing thing if it's true. But I don't want to throw the baby out with the bathwater."

Ideology is a parasite on religious substructures. A religious narrative has a particular set of characteristics. It's very balanced. So for example there's the feminist idea of the patriarchy. Well the religious idea of society has a patriarchal notion built into it. That would be the dying king. The once great dying king. In a religious story, there's the natural world, the chaotic world - there's a positive element and a negative element. Then there's the social world - there's the wise king and the tyrannical king. Then there's the individual world - that's the adversary and the hero. There's always a positive and a negative at each level. And it stops it from being an over simplification."

"There's a transformation to some degree in the Prophetic Tradition, where there is a spirit that rises above the law, but this transformation really takes place in the New Testament. The Old Testament is prohibition, and the New Testament is, 'here's the good things you do once you're more than merely prohibiting yourself from impulsive sin. There's a positive good to be accomplished, not just a negative to be avoided. You have to look around you within your direct sphere of influence, and you fix the things that announce themselves to be in direct need of repair. And those are often small things. They can start with things as simple as: your room. Put it in order. It's not important that you put your room in order necessarily, what is important is that you learn to distinguish between chaos and order, and that you learn to be able to act in a manner that produces order. In most households there's a hundred things that could be done to make it less hideous and horrible. So practicing that is both a useful form of meditation, but it's also a divine act.""Women are attracted to men's ability to generate, to be productive, and to share. These qualities transcend wealth, which can disappear."
